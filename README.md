# arduino_NEO6MV2_GPS
This code enables an arduino to read data from an UBLOX NE06MV2_GPS module and send the data back through the serial port (USB) to a computer.

I found that "Putty" and "Termite" were usful Serial Port reader software. 
N.B. they must be set to 115200

I used the following connections (Will fill this in another time)

Arduino

- Ground -> GPS Ground
- 3.3V   -> GPS 3.3v
- pin 3  ->  
- pin 4  ->  

Resistor divider network (to convert 5v from Arduino to 3.3V)
